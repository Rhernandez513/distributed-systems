Note that you can always just trigger operation manually when starting
process 2, so you can get by without a script, though it is not convenient.<p>

Some ideas:<p>

Thanks Kaz!

I figured out a super clunky way of getting [Multiple Scripts] going [on Mac].  Hopefully it helps
someone else - I'm sure there are lots of ways of improving this, but here's
what I came up with.  The path to my Blockchain.java file is
"Desktop/'CSC_435'/Blockchain", so you can change that depending on what
your folder structure looks like

osascript <<EOF
tell app "Terminal"
do script "cd Desktop/'CSC_435'/Blockchain && java --add-modules -->
				--java.xml.bind Blockchain 0"
end tell

tell app "Terminal"
do script "cd Desktop/'CSC 435'/Blockchain && java --add-modules -->
				--java.xml.bind Blockchain 1"
end tell

tell app "Terminal"
do script "cd Desktop/'CSC 435'/Blockchain && java --add-modules -->
				--java.xml.bind Blockchain 2"
end tell
EOF
</pre>

I started searching around on iTerm's website and found a scripting
reference page.

https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-scripting.html

After creating a new profile called BlockChain to direct the new terminals
to the correct working directory in iTerm I used the following script that
will get all 3 processes running in separate windows and it works like the
demo in class.

Save the below into scriptName.scpt

tell application "iTerm2"
create window with profile "BlockChain" command "java bc 0"
create window with profile "BlockChain" command "java bc 1"
create window with profile "BlockChain" command "java bc 2"
end tell

You can then run > osascript scriptName.scpt

This isn't pretty, but it works for the demo code and I think with some
small tweaks should work for the assignment.

Another solution...not pretty but functional

Copy below to allbat.sh

run chmod 700 on allbat.sh 

run ./allbat.sh at command line

#!/bin/sh

osascript <<END

tell application "Terminal"

    do script ("cd /Users/blah/GitHub/CS435/BlockChain;javac bc.java; java
    bc 0")

end tell

tell application "Terminal"

    do script ("cd /Users/blah/GitHub/CS435/BlockChain;javac bc.java; java
    bc 1")

end tell

tell application "Terminal"

    do script ("cd /Users/blah/GitHub/CS435/BlockChain;javac bc.java; java
    bc 2")

end tell
